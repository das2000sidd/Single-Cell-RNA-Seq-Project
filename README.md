The analysis comprises of analysing single cells from a Covid19 patient pre and post transplant, a healthy lung donor and a second Covid patient.
This analysis showed that postmortem lung tissue from patients from COVID19 patients showed similarity with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and while control lungs from the two studies shared similarity in the latent state after integration of the two datasets.
